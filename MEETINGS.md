> Q: Sketch using custom tools/shapes?

https://devtopia.esri.com/WebGIS/arcgis-js-api/issues/18192 is assigned to 4.11, but no activity. Needs feedback/discussion. Low prio, possibly backlog.

Sketch updates:

No update on dateline issue https://devtopia.esri.com/WebGIS/arcgis-js-api/issues/18463
New issue `Sketch: add property to control display order of tool buttons`

Editor close, and needs testing before it's demo-worthy.

## [Web Editing with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://devsummit2019.schedule.esri.com/schedule/1935651005) (Thursday and will repeat on Friday)

* Decide on session takeaways
    - Showcase Editor, FeatureForm, Sketch/Draw
        - using samples as base
        - show how to wire up non-Editor widgets
    - 2 or 3 editing workflows

* Draft outline
    - Intro
      - Show what's there (status)
      - [Maybe] Walkthrough edit workflow (REST) - help users learn how it works

    - Start simple (focus on Editor) then ramp up difficulty w/ separate pieces
        - showcase FeatureLayer + applyEdits

    - Future plans
        - related records
        - attachments
        - table-form

* Divvy content - for future meeting

* Demo brainstorming
  - start with available samples
    - FeatureForm
        - visibilityExpression
        - grouping
  - advanced editing use cases (attribute-only, geometry-only)
  - geometry validation

### Other notes

* Expect audience from all beginner to advanced
* Do not compare editing w/ 3x, focus on 4x features
* Prep answer for related-record folks
     - revisit related record capabilities
* Q for users: when would you NOT use Editor?
     - batch editing
     - form-driven experience
* Q: Sketch using custom tools/shapes?
* Security: show how to enable & use
